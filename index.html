    <p>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a <strong>placeholder</strong> text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum is typically a <u>corrupted</u> version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC<br> text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.</p>
